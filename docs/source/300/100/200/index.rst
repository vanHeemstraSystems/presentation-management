AI Tools for Content
=====================

Even having a clear idea of the topic of your presentation and being an expert in your field, it can be very challenging to know where to start and write all the content for your presentation.

Well, luckily for us, there are now a couple of super helpful AI tools for that. 

In this Unit, we'll introduce:

- Notion AI and ChatGPT for brainstorming and idea generation. 
- Sharly.ai for simplifying, summarizing, and extracting highlights from existing complex documents, such as reports and whitepapers. 
- And Quillbot for grammar check and paraphrasing.
