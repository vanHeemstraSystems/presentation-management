To get started: nodeppt serve slide.md

A file called ```slide.md``` has ben created in the directory "presentations" at the root of the repository.

Alternatively, create a new slide straight from a github template:

$ nodeppt new slide.md -t vanHeemstraSystems/presentation-management
```

You will be prompted:

```
? slide.md file exists. Continue?: (Use arrow keys)
> overwrite
```

If a slide my the same name was created previously, this is your chance to overwrite it. Or run above command again with a different slide name.

Next, you will be prompted:

```
